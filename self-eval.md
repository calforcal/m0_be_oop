# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - It felt good to pull in all the information and apply it inside the OOP / Created Classes. It's fun to see what we're learning get applied in more advanced ways.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - Workflow has been good, it's really helpful to find the time for a break. Its been a long few days getting used to thinking this much and utilizing new concepts all day long but also fun and exciting.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - I want to remember that even when something doesn't make sense on the first read or walk through, if you practice and repeat the tasks enough times you WILL start to pick up on them and they become more natural.
